			      	<h1>Dharamshala</h1>
			      	<p>
                        Not long after arriving in Mcleodganj, a suburb in Dharamsala, you realize that the comparisons drawn between it and Little Lhasa are hardly exaggerated. It is only to be expected though, as it is the abode of His Holiness the 14th Dalai Lama. Dharamshala is blessed with the same beauty as other parts of the state, but what sets it apart is its strong Tibetan character. You see prayer fluttering prayer flags, monasteries at regular intervals and monks attired in bright saffron robes.
                    </p>
			      	<p>
                        Bhagsunag Falls is another place to visit during your trip to Dharamsala. From a distance, it resembles a long white silk sheet which is split in two as it approaches the base. It lies in close proximity to Mcleodganj and the Bhagsunag Temple. It is best to visit the waterfall from July to September. Dharamshala has a rich past, and visitors are introduced to it at Kangra Art Museum. To reach it, you have to head towards Kotwali Bazaar. It is not big in size, but contains an interesting collection of items. Some of these are the famous miniature paintings of Kangra, arts and crafts, and sculptures that date back to the 5th century.

			      	<h1>Manali</h1>
			      	<p>

                      </p>
                      <p>

			      	<h1>Chamba</h1>
			      	<p>
                        Chamba is the northernmost district of Himachal Pradesh, and lies at the intersection of Dhauladhar and Zanskar ranges. These are facts related to this district, but aren’t particularly interesting. What is interesting is the opening lines of a famous Himachali folk song which go like this - Shimla nahi basna, Kasauli nahi basna, Chamba jana zaroor. When translated, they mean - Don’t settle in Shimla, don’t settle in Kasauli, but certainly visit Chamba. It is only when you spend your holidays in Chamba that you realise the significance of the song. The landscape here is marked by lakes, streams, meadows, alpine tree covers, valleys and rich wildlife. There are historical attractions, and architectural ones.
                      </p>
			      	<p>
                        Some hill stations are known for their beauty, others for their heritage and culture. Chamba combines both of these, and in that way, is different from the other famous hill stations in India. Historical records date its origins to the 2nd century BC, when it was inhabited by the Kolian tribes. Since then, it came under the rule of Rajputs, Pratiharas, Sikh army under Maharaja Ranjit Singh, and the British. It finally merged with India on 15th April, 1948.
